Background:
Enhance API to support setting Solution as a step when creating Workflow

Business Value:

Improve workflow flexibility and reusability.
Allow users to modularize complex solutions and seamlessly integrate them into larger automation processes.
Simplify workflow creation and maintenance by reusing existing solutions.

Scope In:

Enhance the workflow creation API (POST /api/v1/workflows) to allow steps to reference a Solution.
Update data models (DTOs, Entities) to support Solution references in workflow steps.
Validate that referenced Solution IDs exist and are valid when creating workflows.
Ensure existing workflow query and execution logic can properly handle steps containing Solutions.

Acceptance Criteria:

AC1: Successfully create workflow with Solution steps
Given a user provides a valid, existing Solution ID as one of the steps in a workflow creation request
When the user sends a POST request to /api/v1/workflows
Then the system successfully creates the workflow with steps containing Solution references and returns 201 Created status with new workflow details.

AC2: Create workflow with non-existent Solution
Given a user provides a non-existent Solution ID in a workflow creation request
When the user sends a POST request to /api/v1/workflows
Then the system returns 400 Bad Request error with a clear error message indicating the referenced Solution ID is invalid.

AC3: Workflow with mixed step types
Given a workflow is created with steps containing both regular Rule/Prompt steps and Solution steps
When the client requests workflow details
Then the system returns workflow data that clearly displays all steps and correctly distinguishes between Rule/Prompt steps and Solution steps.

AC4: Data persistence validation
Given a workflow with Solution steps has been successfully saved to the database
When developers check the related records in the database
Then the step information stored in the database correctly and structurally saves Solution references.
